### Hi, I'm Matthew Magaldi ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a student, engineer, entreprenuer, father, and aspiring gardener & farmer

- I'm the Head of Engineering & Founding Engineer at [Chariot](https://www.givechariot.com/) where we are on a mission to change the way people give in order to grow the kindness market to 10% of GDP.

- Previously, I led a team of engineers at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/) where I helped build the core capabilities of [Aladdin Wealth](https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin/products/aladdin-wealth) which powers the portfolio and risk management solutions for wealth managers and financial advisors across the globe who collectively manage millions of clients' portfolios and trillions of dollars of assets. My 7-year tenure taught me many lessons that I use to this day including how to effectively manage a team, design systems for future adaptibility and scale, and most importantly, work with empathy, humility, and care.

- Before starting my professional career, I studied electrical and computer engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science degree and a minor in business in 2016. I also graduated with an [Engineering Leadership Certification](https://leadership.engineering.cornell.edu/) as part of a highly selective 1-year program to develop engineers as leaders and team members.

- Here is [ðŸ“š my reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68216178-matthew-magaldi?utf8=âœ“&shelf=read&title=matthew-magaldi&per_page=infinite)

- ðŸŒ± In my spare time, you can find me tending to my ever-expanding perennial and vegetable gardens, cycling on backroads in the Hudson Valley, and reading by the fire with my family.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have an identical twin brother and grew up on a small dairy goat farm in northwest CT
